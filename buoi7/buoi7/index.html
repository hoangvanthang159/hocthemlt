          <h2>My Career So Far</h2>
          <p>
            Always up for a challenge, I have worked for lean start-ups and was
            a member of the first New Zealand start-up to attend Y Combinator,
            the largest start-up accelerator in the world. From there, I worked
            my way up to Art Director and Team Lead at Appster where I oversaw
            the design of 30+ mobile and desktop apps. Currently I am a Senior
            Product Designer at Linktree leading design for the Linktree mobile
            app.

            "Sebastian is a guru at all things UX design, consistently producing
            intuitive, modern, and bold designs. He is a natural problem solver
            in the design space so everyone went to him if they were stuck on a
            feature or flow. He has an arsenal of design skills including
            animation and graphic design. Not to mention, Seb was a design team
            lead, which means he managed a full team of both onshore and
            offshore designs reviewing and providing feedback on all of their
            designs... Any business would be lucky to have him."
